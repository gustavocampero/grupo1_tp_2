/// @file ring_buffer.h
/// @brief Defines a ring buffer data structure and associated functions in C.
///
/// A ring buffer, also known as a circular buffer, is a data structure that uses a fixed-size
/// buffer which wraps around itself. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need
/// to efficiently manage a continuous stream of data with a fixed buffer size.
///
/// This file provides the definition of the ring buffer structure and functions to initialize,
/// read from, and write to the buffer.
